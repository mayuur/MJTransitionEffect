MJTransitionEffect
===================

Transition from UITableViewCell to Detail Controller with animation on ENTER and EXIT. This can be seen in multiple apps. Right now, it is totally customizable. There are 3 sections for these animations : (1). Initially set frames for all UI elements (2). Now the animation on ENTER is completed and you have to set the frames according to the Detail UI you need. (3). This is the section where EXIT animation will apply. These frames will be equal to the frames which were initially set. However, all these sections are totally CUSTOMIZABLE and user can set it according to their own needs!
